# EncodeX  - CLI Crypto Tool 🔐

A lightweight, command-line interface (CLI) cryptography tool built with Python. This tool allows users to generate secure encryption keys, encrypt sensitive plaintext messages, and decrypt them back to their original form using the robust Fernet (symmetric encryption) algorithm.

## 🚀 Features

* **Key Generation:** Generates a cryptographically secure, URL-safe base64-encoded key.
* **Message Encryption:** Encrypts standard text into unreadable ciphertext.
* **Message Decryption:** Reverts ciphertext back to readable plaintext using the correct secret key.
* **Interactive CLI:** Easy-to-use menu-driven interface.

## 📋 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `cryptography` library

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevVettel/EncodeX(https://github.com/DevVettel/EncodeX.git)
   cd EncodeX



Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install cryptography



💻 Usage
Run the main script to start the interactive tool:

```bash
python crypto_tool.py




⚠️ Security Disclaimer
This tool is created for educational purposes to demonstrate the basics of symmetric cryptography. Keep your secret.key file secure. If you lose the key, you will not be able to decrypt your messages. Anyone with access to your secret.key can decrypt your messages.
